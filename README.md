# blurred-image-mover
This code detects blurred images and moves them from one folder to another

The blur.py file is just a program to find out if a picture is blurred or not.

The blur_mover.py is the actual program which you would want to run to move all the blurry pics from a folder (pictures in this case) to a desired folder(blurry_pics in this case).
Just type in the path of the original  folder and the destination folder in the basepath and the dest_path variables and you're all set.
Easy way to get rid of all the blurry pics which you had clicked by mistake.
